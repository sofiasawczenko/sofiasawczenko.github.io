### Chatbot with RAG using LangChain and OpenAI

This project showcases the development of a console-based chatbot leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), powered by LangChain and OpenAIâ€™s large language model. RAG is a powerful technique that combines traditional retrieval methods with generative AI, enabling the chatbot to provide highly relevant and context-aware responses.

In this implementation, the system scans and indexes a collection of PDF documents stored locally. When a user asks a question, the chatbot retrieves relevant information from the indexed PDFs and feeds it into the language model, allowing it to generate accurate and contextually grounded answers.
  Key components and features include:
  
  - LangChain for chaining components like retrievers, language models, and memory.
  
   - OpenAI API for natural language understanding and generation.
  
  - PDF loaders for parsing and processing local documents.
  
  - Vector stores to embed and search relevant chunks of text.
  
  - Designed for terminal use, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

### Building a Cricket Statistics Pipeline with Google Cloud Services

Develop a comprehensive cricket statistics pipeline leveraging Google Cloud services for efficient data processing and visualization. The pipeline begins with data retrieval from the Cricbuzz API, storing the data securely as CSV files in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which provides scalable and durable storage for large datasets. A Cloud Function is configured to automatically trigger upon file uploads in GCS, initiating the pipeline by seamlessly passing parameters to a Dataflow job. This Dataflow job processes and loads the data into BigQuery, a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse designed for fast and scalable analytics. Finally, a Looker Studio dashboard connects to BigQuery, enabling real-time visualization and analysis of the cricket statistics.

### Predicting Heart Failure with Supervised Learning Classification 
Heart failure is a serious medical condition that occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can happen when the heart muscle becomes weakened or damaged, leading to a decrease in its ability to effectively pump blood.  In this project, I employed supervised learning, a method where a model learns from a labeled dataset. The output variable indicates whether a patient is susceptible to heart failure or not, often represented by classes like "at risk of heart failure" and "not at risk of heart failure".

<img src= 'https://github.com/sofiasawczenko/sofiasawczenko.github.io/blob/master/images/imagem_heart.png?raw=true'/>

This heart failure prediction project uses a Kaggle dataset, where several data preprocessing techniques were applied, followed by validations using methods like logistic regression, cross-validation, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, KNN and SVM.

### Predicting House Prices with Supervised Learning Regression
Real estate prices in Boston can be influenced by a multitude of factors, from location and size to local market trends. In this project, I utilized supervised regression learning, a technique where a model learns from labeled data and analyzes the relationship between variables for accurate predictions, considering factors like location, size, and market trends. The goal is to model this relationship and make precise estimations based on the data.

### Forecasting the weather in New York City with Supervised Learning Ridge Regression 
In this project, I employed Supervised Ridge Regression Learning to forecast weather patterns in New York City based on historical data from 1970 to 2022. Ridge regression is a variant of linear regression that introduces a regularization term to the model. This term helps prevent overfitting by penalizing overly complex models. By striking a balance between accuracy and simplicity, ridge regression proves invaluable in accurately predicting weather conditions based on historical data.
