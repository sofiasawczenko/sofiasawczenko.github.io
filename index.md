### Autonomous robot with a navigation system based on computer vision

Computer vision is a technology that enables robots to process visual data from the environment using a combination of camera hardware and computer algorithms. They are equipped with sensors to visualize and perceive the surroundings and effectors to interact with the outside world.

### Predicting Heart Failure with Supervised Learning Classification 
Heart failure is a serious medical condition that occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can happen when the heart muscle becomes weakened or damaged, leading to a decrease in its ability to effectively pump blood.  In this project, I employed supervised learning, a method where a model learns from a labeled dataset. The output variable indicates whether a patient is susceptible to heart failure or not, often represented by classes like "at risk of heart failure" and "not at risk of heart failure".

### Predicting House Prices with Supervised Learning Regression
Real estate prices in Boston can be influenced by a multitude of factors, from location and size to local market trends. In this project, I utilized supervised regression learning, a technique where a model learns from labeled data and analyzes the relationship between variables for accurate predictions, considering factors like location, size, and market trends. The goal is to model this relationship and make precise estimations based on the data.

### Forecasting the weather in New York City with Supervised Learning Ridge Regression 
In this project, I employed Supervised Ridge Regression Learning to forecast weather patterns in New York City. Ridge regression is a variant of linear regression that introduces a regularization term to the model. This term helps prevent overfitting by penalizing overly complex models. By striking a balance between accuracy and simplicity, ridge regression proves invaluable in accurately predicting weather conditions based on historical data.

### Time Series Analysis for Vehicle Sales
In this project, using libraries like Pandas for tabular data visualization and manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for constructing graphs, I analyzed the quantity of vehicle sales over a period of time. Given the significance of the time factor, I employed time series analysis to effectively quantify the growth and decline in sales.

### Unsupervised Learning Regression to predict Estimated Landing Time
The most common causes of flight delays are varied. While some are not related to accessible data, others are within reach. The inaccessible data will remain as noise caused from security, maintenance and disaster issues. The accessible data are weather and congestion that will shed some light to predict some of the flight delays
